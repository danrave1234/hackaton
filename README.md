# Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript Blank Project

This is a minimal starter with organized folders:
- pages/index.html
- style/styles.css
- js/script.js

How to use:
1. Open pages/index.html in your browser (double-click it or drag it into a browser window).
2. You should see a simple page with a button. Click the button to confirm JavaScript is working.

Notes:
- The HTML links to CSS and JS using relative paths: ../style/styles.css and ../js/script.js
- You can add more pages to the pages/ folder and reuse the same CSS/JS by keeping the same relative paths.
