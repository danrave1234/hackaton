# Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript Blank Project

This is a minimal starter with organized folders:
- index.html
- style/styles.css
- js/script.js

How to use:
1. Open index.html in your browser (double-click it or drag it into a browser window).
2. You should see a simple page with a button. Click the button to confirm JavaScript is working.

Notes:
- The root index.html links to CSS and JS using: style/styles.css and js/script.js
- You can add more pages to the pages/ folder; those pages should link using ../style/styles.css and ../js/script.js.
