1. The Hunter-Seeker (Follow & Collide)
   Class: Specialist Unit
   Design Concept: This drone is less of a ship and more of a heavily armored, autonomous guided missile. Its sole purpose is to achieve a target lock on the U.X.F. Stiletto and pursue it relentlessly for a direct collision. It has no ranged weapons, but its high speed and durable chassis make it a significant physical threat.
   Appearance: A sleek, arrow-head shaped drone with a single, glowing red optical sensor at its tip. It has powerful thrusters on its back that flare brightly when it's accelerating. It's built for ramming, so its front is a thick, reinforced plate of metal.
   Behavior:
   Lock-on Phase: Upon entering the screen, the Hunter-Seeker will hover for a brief moment, its red eye blinking as it acquires a target lock on the player.
   Pursuit Phase: Once locked, its thrusters ignite, and it charges in a direct, high-speed line towards the player's last known position.
   Correction: If the player moves, the Hunter-Seeker has a slight delay before it can correct its course, creating opportunities for the player to dodge and make it crash into terrain or other enemies.
   Threat: Its primary danger is forcing the player to move from an optimal position. A swarm of these can quickly box the player in, making them vulnerable to other enemy fire.

2. The Geo-Lancer (Shooter with Asteroid)
   Class: Standard Unit
   Design Concept: A drone that has integrated itself with an asteroid for both camouflage and armor. It's a semi-stationary threat that acts like a hidden turret. It drills into larger asteroids, lying dormant until the player approaches, at which point it activates to attack.
   Appearance: When inactive, it looks like a regular asteroid with a few metallic seams. When it activates, panels retract, and a glowing cannon barrel extends from its center. Its body is a fusion of jagged rock and mechanical plating, making it look like a piece of weaponized terrain.
   Behavior:
   Ambush Tactic: Geo-Lancers are often found in dense asteroid fields. They remain inert and untargetable until the player gets within a certain range.
   Focused Fire: Once active, it doesn't move. It fires powerful, straight-line energy lances at the player. These shots are highly damaging but have a noticeable charge-up time, telegraphing the attack.
   Armor: The asteroid shell provides excellent protection. The player must focus fire on its extended cannon barrel, which is its primary weak point.
   Threat: Geo-Lancers turn seemingly safe environments into deadly traps. They punish reckless flying and reward careful observation, forcing players to methodically clear out asteroid fields instead of rushing through them.

3. The Fabricator (Summoner & Attacker)
   Class: Heavy Unit
   Design Concept: A mobile-factory drone that acts as a field commander and minion spawner. It is larger and slower than most units but is heavily armed and armored. Its core function is to produce an endless stream of smaller, weaker drones while harassing the player with its own powerful weapons.
   Appearance: A bulky, boxy drone with multiple robotic arms and assembly ports on its chassis. It has a large central "eye" and two heavy-duty cannon emplacements. You can see smaller drone parts being assembled and deployed from its bays.
   Behavior:
   Summoning Cycle: Every few seconds, the Fabricator will pause its attack, and its assembly ports will glow. It will then deploy a small wave of Gnats (the small swarm units) into the battlefield.
   Direct Attack: In between summoning cycles, it attacks the player directly with its twin cannons, firing slow-moving but powerful plasma spheres that are difficult to destroy.
   High Priority: The Fabricator is always the most dangerous enemy on screen. If left unchecked, it will flood the area with minions, making it impossible to navigate or focus on other threats.
   Threat: Its dual-threat nature is its greatest weapon. Players must constantly balance the need to destroy the summoned Gnats with the need to deal damage to the Fabricator itself before they are completely overwhelmed.
